KBT Vega is the student aerospace club at MVPS's KBT College of Engineering. This initiative was born out of boredom, just as a hobby project - to try amateur rocketry. From there, it has now grown into a student club with a grand mission - to build and launch student built satellites into orbit. I am one of the founding members, and I worked as the Technical Lead (basically Deputy Director), specifically leading the development of payload firmware and the avionics bay. The current project is to build a CanSat to study environmental effects on bird populations.
