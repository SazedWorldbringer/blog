This project, KPTR, was built in collaboration with Kapse Paithani, India's largest Paithani manufacturer. We built an end-to-end traceability platform to ensure authenticity of the Paithani sarees, cultivate transparency in the entire process, and highlight stories of the artisans. Learning about the entire process and hearing the deeply personal stories made this project special.

This project was also recognized by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi at BharatTex 2025.
