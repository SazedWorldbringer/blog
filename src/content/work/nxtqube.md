NxtQube builds fully autonomous Drone Docking Stations, enabling missions at remote sites enabling surveillance, monitoring, and inspection of critical infrastructure. Here, I developed and tested embedded firmware for dock peripherals in Python and C++, and was assigned maintenance of legacy docks and firmware. Testing precision landing at night (low light conditions, I mean) was the best part.
